I'm working on a data structure that will hold details about morfs, sessions/tasks, tracking and general user information.
This will evolve over time, but the general need is to support the presentation of each task with data the way you have described it to us.

Some questions:
---------------
* Are some morfs / words inappropriate to use in some task types?
  Alternatively stated, which if any of the tasks are generic enough to support all the 'morfs' you want to display?
    - it is likely we must keep a record of which tasks can be used with which 'morf' + supporting media

* Will a user always receive a word they have never seen before?
    - in tasks across a session?
    - and sessions across weeks?
    If yes then we must keep a record in the user's account of which words they have already seen


PILOT
-----

->  Each user will be given an ID to connect with.

->  Two groups

    Group 1:
        24 'mis' morphs  (= 24 total tasks) taken from any of the task types
        4  'u'   morphs  (= 24 total tasks taken from all 6 of the task types per morph)


    Group 2:
        24 'u'   morphs  (= 24 total tasks) taken from any of the task types
        4  'mis' morphs  (= 24 total tasks taken from all 6 of the task types per morph)


->  Track the items listed below to our own DB

->  Run on a single platform to begin with (PC browser)

->  Account for button sizes & screen adjustment for tablet if possible!



Task & Session Tracking
-----------------------
Also, here is the translation of the tracking requirements as I understand them, including both øvingsøktene and testøktene in one set.
Please comment if I have misundersood!


ID Number (the user identifier)
Start and end time for the session (date & time)
Number of attempts to complete task
    - how to measure this with 'drag and drop multiple items' type task?
Number of attempts / total possible attempts
    - how do we rate the total possible attempts?
 ( Time used on each task (duration) (take from Session start / end time) )   **Calculable**
 ( Time used on session (duration) (take from Session start / end time) )     **Calculable**
Number of inactive periods over 30s
Duration of inactive periods over 30s                                         **Calculable**
Correct or incorrect answer (in case of 'unforgiving' session)
